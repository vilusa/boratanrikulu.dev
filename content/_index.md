title: About me
---

My interest in server management and cybersecurity resulting from meeting with GNU / Linux operating systems caused me to choose computer engineering as a profession. I am currently studying at Pamukkale University.

Although server management has a big impact on me to lead this profession, my interest can move to other parties. Since I want to experience by playing a role in all areas of the development process, I try not to hesitate to focus on different areas.

For about 1 year, I developed myself on Ruby / Rails, where I felt philosophically close to my ideas to improve myself on the web. I still actively use Ruby and Rails.

Now I feel closer to DevOps, and I do my research and studies on this field. I am looking for a job where I will gain experience in DevOps.m.
